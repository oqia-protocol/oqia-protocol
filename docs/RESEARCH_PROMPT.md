# Research Prompt: Free Tools and Services for Oqia Protocol

**Objective:** Identify and evaluate free tools, services, and resources that can be used to enhance the development, security, and performance of the Oqia Protocol without incurring additional costs.

**Key Areas of Focus:**

1.  **Smart Contract Development & Security:**
    *   **Static Analysis:** Find free static analysis tools that can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect security vulnerabilities in Solidity code.
    *   **Formal Verification:** Explore free or open-source tools for formally verifying the correctness of smart contract logic.
    *   **Gas Optimization:** Research free tools and techniques for analyzing and optimizing the gas consumption of smart contracts.
    *   **Security Audit Platforms:** Are there any platforms that offer free or community-driven security audits for open-source projects?

2.  **Off-Chain Infrastructure & Performance:**
    *   **Decentralized Storage:** Investigate free tiers or grants for decentralized storage solutions like IPFS and Arweave.
    *   **Vector Databases:** Are there any open-source or free-tier vector databases suitable for storing and querying off-chain agent knowledge?
    *   **Monitoring & Analytics:** Find free services for monitoring the health and performance of the off-chain infrastructure and smart contracts.

3.  **Frontend & User Experience:**
    *   **UI/UX Design:** Explore free UI/UX design tools and resources for creating a professional and user-friendly frontend.
    *   **Frontend Frameworks & Libraries:** Research free and open-source frontend frameworks and libraries that can be used to build the Oqia Protocol's user interface.

4.  **Community & Collaboration:**
    *   **Bug Bounty Platforms:** Are there any free or low-cost bug bounty platforms for open-source projects?
    *   **Project Management & Collaboration:** Explore free project management and collaboration tools for managing the development process and engaging with the community.

**Output:**

A comprehensive report that lists and evaluates the free tools and services identified in each of the key areas. The report should include:

*   A brief description of each tool or service.
*   Its key features and benefits.
*   Its limitations and potential drawbacks.
*   A recommendation on whether or not to use it for the Oqia Protocol.
