Great, the Oqia Bot Factory is implemented and tested. Now, let's complete the `AgentLinker.sol` contract.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **~~Implement the Oqia Key Dispatcher~~**
    -   ~~Create the `OqiaKeyDispatcher.sol` contract.~~
    -   ~~Add a method to store and retrieve the latest session key for each agent wallet.~~
    -   ~~Write tests to ensure the dispatcher is working correctly.~~
2.  **~~Implement the Oqia Bot Factory~~**
    -   ~~Create the `OqiaBotFactory.sol` contract.~~
    -   ~~The factory should mint an ownership NFT (ERC-721) for each new agent.~~
    -   ~~The factory should create an `OqiaAgentWallet.sol` contract for each new agent.~~
    -   ~~Write tests to ensure the factory is working correctly.~~
3.  **Implement the Agent Linker**
    -   ~~Create the `AgentLinker.sol` contract.~~
    -   The linker should allow agents to securely connect with each other.
    -   This will be a critical component for enabling agent-to-agent communication and collaboration.

Let's get started on the `AgentLinker.sol` contract. I'll create the initial file in the `contracts` directory.
